7.7 Exercises
1. A:
Yes, it is a legal Python program for the following reasons.

For one thing, the function proc() is well-defined.

For another, when the function proc() is called in main(), it returns the value
11, which is then assigned to the variable x.

The above behaviors are totally legal in Python.


2. A:
Yes, it is a legal Python program for the following reasons.

For one thing, the function proc() is well-defined.

For another, when the function proc() is called twice in main(), it returns the
value 7 and 6 that are assigned to the the variable x and y respectively.

The above behaviors are totally legal in Python.


3. A:
Yes, it is a legal Python program for the following reasons.

For one thing, the function proc() is well-defined.

For another, when the function proc() is called in main(), it first prints the
value 7 and then returns the value None that is assigned to the variable x.

The above behaviors are totally legal in Python.


4. A:
Yes, it is a legal Python program for the following reasons.

For one thing, the function proc() is well-defined.

For another, when the function is called in main() with two input values, it
returns the value 26 that is then passed in print(). Then the print() function
prints out the input value 26.

The above behaviors are totally legal in Python.


5. A:
No, it is not a legal Python program for the following reason.

The function proc() is defined to takes two arguments. However, when it is
called in the main() function, it only takes one argument, which produces a
TypeError.


6. A:
No, it is not a legal Python program for the following reason.

The proc() function is defined to takes just one argument. However, when
it is called in the main() function, it takes two argument, which produces a
TypeError.


7. A:
Yes, it is a legal Python program for the following reasons.

For one thing, the function proc() is well-defined.

For another, when the function proc() is called in the main() function, it
prints out the value 100.

The above behaviors are totally legal in Python.


8. A:
The program prints 10 instead because proc() doesn't return any value so
that the value stored in the num variable is not changed at all.


9. A:
Yes. It is legal to use the same variable name x in two different
functions because the variables in a certain function are local to this
specific function only.


10. A:
Yes. Variable names are just symbols and doesn't have any influence on
their functions.
