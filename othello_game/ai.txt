• Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something
  more clever than just pick a random legal move?
  A:
  Yes, I attempted to make my computer player (Player2) do something more
  clever than just pick a random legal move.

• If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as
  you would like?
  A:
  Yes, I was able to accomplish this. And my computer player (Player2) is as
  smart as I would like.

• How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next
  move” algorithm?
  A:
  Loop through every square on the board:
      If the square is empty:
          Search for all possible flips for this empty square.
          If there are flips for this empty square:
              Count all the flips in all the directions and keep the counts in
              a dictionary.

  If there are flips in the dictionary:
      Sort the flip counts for all the legal moves in ascending order.
      Find the best move that has the most flip count.

• How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever
  tested it out for you?
  A:
  There were 50% chance that the computer (Player2) would beat me, or my
  friends.

• How would you improve it in the future?
  A:
  I would take the distance of legal move to the boundaries into account
  because the closer it is, the greater the chance to compass and flips more
  opposing tiles is.
