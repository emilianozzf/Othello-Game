A Bullet-pointed Pseudocode of my Driver (the flow of control):
    When the user tries to make an illegal move:
        Donnot raise an error. Do nothing instead.

    When the user makes a legal move:
        Put a new black tile on the board and flip the corresponding white
        tiles.

    When it’s the computer’s turn:
        Pause for a little while and then put a new white tile at a legal
        position with the best chance to beat the user. Flip the corresponding
        black tiles.

    When the game is over (there are no more legal moves):
        Pronounce the winner and show the scores of both the user and the
        computer. Store the user's score in the file scores.txt.
